# Hudello Coding Challenge: Frontend

Welcome to our frontend coding challenge. In this exercise, you'll create a responsive web app that asks users a series of questions and display their responses on the screen as the questions progress. [Demo](https://hudello-engineering.web.app/conversation)

This exercise is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution/implementation. Feel free to use any frameworks/packages/tools as you see fit; the goal is a functional app with a reasonable amount of CSS stylings. Backend implementation is not required.

Since we use Next.js as our frontend framework, we've included it as part of the repo; if you wish to use it, here's a good [starting point](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

## To get started:
1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Implement your code.
3. Send us a link to your repo for review.

Happy coding!
